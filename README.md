### Hi there <a href="https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="5%"></a> 
My name is Facundo Martín Corengia, and I'm a 🤖 Data Scientist with a background in customer service. I have solid soft skills and can work well both independently and in a team. I've been interested in technology since a young age, particularly in the area of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, where I'm looking to continue growing.  
  
I have experience with tools such as 🐍 Python, 💾 SQL, 📊 Power BI Desktop, 👀 Looker Studio, ☁️ Google Cloud Platform, 🚀 AWS, 🧠 Scikit-Learn, 🤖 TensorFlow, and 🚀 PyTorch.  
  
My current goal is to keep developing as a Data Scientist and explore the potential of Machine Learning and AI. I stand out for both my technical skills and my ability to work in a team.
